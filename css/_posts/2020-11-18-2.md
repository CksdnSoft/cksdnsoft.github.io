The line-height property is fascinating. It is different from the height property. Yet when a element has a single line of text only, with height undefined, line-height is the height of the element.

Let's look at different examples where line-height works differently

## text inside div

Line height works whenever there is text.
html

    <div class="asdf">
	    hello world
    </div>
css

    .asdf {
	    font-size: 15px;
	    line-height: 1;
	   }
    

## text inside span inside div
asdf

## text inside flexbox
