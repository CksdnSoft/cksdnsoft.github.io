title: Thoughts on CSS
---
The thing about CSS is that people don't learn it properly. Most of the time CSS is taught in a HTML/CSS tutorial or an HTML/CSS/Javascript tutorial. It is not taught in a tutorial teaching CSS only. I think this makes people care less about CSS when they are learning web development.
Not learning CSS properly means you cannot add design to your website proficiently. And CSS can be very tricky most of the time. So I think it is important to learn CSS in order to be a full-stack web developer. It doesn't even take that much time.
