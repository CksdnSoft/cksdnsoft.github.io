title: Usage with stackedit
---

Using Jekyll with stackedit is awesome.

## First step
In the right sidebar menu, go to `Workspaces > Add a GitHub workspace`. Then, add my github repo for my static website.
After that, stackedit will automatically fetch all of the .md files and list them nicely on the left sidebar.

## Second step
Edit or create files. Make sure to not put the .md extension after the filename. I have tried it: the file is commited to github as `filename.md.md`. Sidenote: this is technically okay for Jekyll as Jekyll simply reads this file as `<filename.md>.md`.
StackEdit will automatically synchronize with github for me. If I want to manually synchronize, I can click on the synchronize button on the top bar.

## Third step
Final step is to make sure my static Jekyll website displays everything just like Stackedit;
