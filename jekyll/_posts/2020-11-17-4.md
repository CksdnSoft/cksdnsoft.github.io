title: Usage with stackedit

Using Jekyll with stackedit is awesome.

## First step
In the right sidebar menu, go to `Workspaces > Add a GitHub workspace`. Then, add my github repo for my static website.

## Second step
Edit or create files. Make sure to not put the .md extension after the filename. I have tried it
