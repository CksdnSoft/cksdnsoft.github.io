The basic unit of web development is a single page.

    <html>
    <head>
	    <style>
	    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>

html is the start and end of a webpage. CSS and JS works with html.
The style works only on the html of that page. The JS as well. For every page, you can import the same css stylesheet. Let's call it main.txt.
