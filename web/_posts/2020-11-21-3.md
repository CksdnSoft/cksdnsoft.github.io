The basic unit of web development is a single page.

**index.html**

    <html>
    <head>
	    <style>
	    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>

html is the start and end of a webpage. CSS and JS works with html.
The style works only on the html of that page. The JS as well. The part inside `<style>` tags is called the stylesheet. For every page, I can import the same css stylesheet. Let's call it main.txt.

**index.html**

    <html>
    <head>
	    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.txt">
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>

**main.txt**

    *  {
	border:  5px  solid  black;
	}

It doesn't fucking work. Because the name of the file has a .txt extension.
