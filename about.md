Hello, I am a CS major at Seoul National University. I made this website while studying to be a full-stack developer. I am also interested in operating systems, databases, encryption (+ mathematics), and computer networks. I am not into algorithms and artificial intelligence.

저는 현재 서울대학교 컴퓨터공학부에 재학중인 학부생입니다.
