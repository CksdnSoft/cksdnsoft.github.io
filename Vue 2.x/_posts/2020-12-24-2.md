My guide to Vue.

Changing the Vue prototype
There must be a root Vue instance that is mounted on a div. Then there must be Vue instances that are mounted automatically when there are certain tags. This is called components.

I can mount root Vue instances onto DOM elements,  in two ways.

The first way is:

    const vm = new Vue({
	    el: '#app'
	})

This automatically mounts the Vue instance `vm` onto a DOM element with id 'app' after creating `vm`

The second way is:

    const vm = new Vue({...}).$mount('#app')

This mounts the instance onto a DOM element with id 'app' after creating vm as well. In this case, however, you can seperate the two process like this:

    const vm = new Vue({...})
    vm.m
