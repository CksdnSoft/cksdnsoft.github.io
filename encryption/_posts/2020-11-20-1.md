title: Thoughts on encryption
---
I have a method that encrypts a data when given a data and a key. It can also decrypt an encryption when given a encryption and the key used to encrypt.

I could keep the method private or public. Public methods tend to be stronger.

In a case where the method is very simple,  the key must obviously stay private.
