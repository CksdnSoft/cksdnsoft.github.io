# Private-Key Encryption (Symmetric-key setting)
I have a blackbox that encrypts a data when given a data and a key. It can also decrypt an encryption when given a encryption and the key used to encrypt.

I could keep the methods used in the box private or public. Public methods tend to be stronger as they undergo more scrutiny.

The key must obviously stay private.

If an eavesdropper tries to decrypt the ciphertext, then he's first choice will be to  run the decryption method on all possible keys. (exhaustive search attack) If there are more than a sufficient amount of possible keys, this method won't work. (sufficient key-space principle)

## Known-plaintext attack
The only reason I would want to keep the methods private is: if an hacker knows the plaintext and the ciphertext and the method then he can get rather easily get the private key. This is called a known-plaintext attack. However, pretty much all encryption algorithms today are not susceptible to this attack. Therefore, there is no point in keeping the methods secret.

Now that the key is the only thing not public, I will

# Hashing
What if I make a blackbox that includes a method to encrypt the data, but not decrypt the data?

This doesn't seem very different from what I have discussed above. The story completely changes however when I say I want to make the number of total possible ciphertexts less than the total number of possible plaintexts.

I want neither the hacker nor I be able to decrypt the ciphertext. This is called cryptographic hashing. It seems like magic, but is is possible.

Hashing can be made so that it is easily decryptable (list possible plaintexts), but with enough effort, it can be made so that it is impossible to list possible plaintexts at the first place. So it is impossible to decrypt.

However, due to the pigeonhole principle, every hashing function has a collision. For example, if a hacker has a hash, and starts a brute force attack to get the plaintext, he shouldn't be able to easily find another plaintext that  has the same hash easily. If the hacker cannot find another plaintext, then the hacker is just using classic brute force methods to figure out the password, which is not a concern in cryptography. (It is rather a concern of security and user experience, where users must use a more secure password).

So it is technically possible to insert another password and still get authenticated, if the fake password has the same hash as the real password.

In this case, it can be thought that collisions are more important in the context where the hacker already knows the plaintext, and want to get another plaintext that can 

So how do I make sure that it is really hard for hackers to find a collision for a particular 

## Collision resistant

## Merkle-Damgard Transform

# Secure password
Use password managing apps like 1password in order to keep secure passwords and not get attacked by hackers.

* Do not use C's rand() function in the stdlib.h library for cryptographic uses.
