# Private-Key Encryption (Symmetric-key setting)
I have a blackbox that encrypts a data when given a data and a key. It can also decrypt an encryption when given a encryption and the key used to encrypt.

I could keep the methods used in the box private or public. Public methods tend to be stronger as they undergo more scrutiny.

The key must obviously stay private.

If an eavesdropper tries to decrypt the ciphertext, then he's first choice will be to  run the decryption method on all possible keys. (exhaustive search attack) If there are more than a sufficient amount of possible keys, this method won't work. (sufficient key-space principle)

## Known-plaintext attack
The only reason I would want to keep the methods private is: if an hacker knows the plaintext and the ciphertext and the method then he can get rather easily get the private key. This is called a known-plaintext attack. However, pretty much all encryption algorithms today are not susceptible to this attack. Therefore, there is no point in keeping the methods secret.

# Hashing
What if I make a blackbox that includes a method to encrypt the data, but not decrypt the data?

This doesn't seem very different from what I have discussed above. The story completely changes however when I say I want to make the number of 

I want neither the hacker nor I be able to decrypt the ciphertext. This is called hashing. It seems like magic, but is is possible.

Now that the key is the only thing not public, I will

Do not use C's rand() function in the stdlib.h library for cryptographic uses.
