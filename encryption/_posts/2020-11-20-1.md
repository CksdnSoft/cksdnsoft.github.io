title: Thoughts on encryption
---
I have a box that encrypts a data when given a data and a key. It can also decrypt an encryption when given a encryption and the key used to encrypt.

I could keep the methods used in the box private or public. Public methods tend to be stronger as they undergo more scrutiny.

The key must obviously stay private.

If an eavesdropper tries to decrypt the encryption, then he's first choice will be to  run the decryption method on all possible keys. (exhaustive search attack) If there are more than a sufficient amount of possible keys, this method won't work. (sufficient key-space principle)

The only reason I would want to keep the methods private is that if an hacker knows the plaintext and the encrypted data and the method than he can get the private key. This is called a 

 - Caesar Cipher
 - Mono-alphabetic substitution cipher

Do not use C's rand() function in the stdlib.h library for cryptographic uses.
