## Static

## Template
Templates are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document. Flask uses the  [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/)  template library to render templates. [source]: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/templates/

By default, the folder containing the template (files) are inside the template folder of the apps parent directory. However, I can change the path of the template directory to use by
```
app = flask.Flask(__name__, template_folder = './')
```
