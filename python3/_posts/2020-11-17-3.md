title: Object Oriented Programming in python
---

Everything in Python is Object Oriented.

For example, if I write

    testvar = 3

Then, a number object with property 3 is created and referenced by *testvar*. *testvar* does not reference a primitive data type like in C or other languages. **It references a object.**

In fact, there is no primitive data types at all. Therefore, when I say *data type* when I am using Python, what I am talking about is the kind of object a variable is, 100% of the time. **Data type means what kind of class the variable is.**

Therefore, *built-in types* in python means the classes that are by default understood by the interpreter.
