title: Truth value testing
---
Suppose I have a variable called **testvar**.

## None

    testvar = None
    if testvar:
	    print("asdf")

The result is:

...nothing.

This shows that null variables are evaluated as false in if conditions.

## String

    testvar = ""
    if testvar:
	    print("asdf")

The result is:

...also nothing.

This shows that when I use an if statement with only a string variable, if the string variable is an empty string, the statement if false.

## Truth Valu

This kind of thing I am doing is called Truth Value Testing.

Each built-in data type, an object, can be tested for a truth value.
