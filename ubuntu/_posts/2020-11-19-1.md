What the fuck is an Ubuntu snap?

It has been one year since I have started using Ubuntu, and most of the time I relied on apt-get to install anything that I needed.

Until now, when I wanted to download chaseapp, which is available on the snap store for ubuntu.

Snap is a "bundle" of an app and its dependencies that works without modification across many different linux distributions.
